Yellow blocks are represented by their positions in the grid.\n\n2. **Change Yellow to Green**:\n    - Wherever a yellow block is identified, replace that block with a green one in the corresponding output grid position.\n\n3. **Maintain Other Block Colors**:\n    - Ensure that all non-yellow blocks retain their original colors (dark purple remains dark purple, dark blue remains dark blue) during the transformation process.\n\n### Analysis Example:\n\nTaking a closer look at the specific transformation depicted in the provided grids:\n\n#### Input Grid Analysis:\n```\nYellow Blocks:\n- Positioned at multiple unique locations forming a pattern observed in the input grid.\n\nDark Purple Blocks:\n- Filling most of the remaining grid, providing the foundational color.\n\nDark Blue Blocks:\n- Scattered within", "7b6016b9": "To fully describe the transformation occurring between the Train Input 1 grid and the Train Output 1 grid, let's analyze the components and modifications step-by-step:\n\n### Input Grid Analysis:\n1. **Colors used**: \n   - Background: Dark purple.\n   - Lines: Yellow.\n\n2. **Structure**:\n   - The grid consists of horizontal and vertical yellow lines forming rectangular and square shapes of various sizes.\n\n### Output Grid Analysis:\n1. **Colors used**:\n   - Background: Medium blue.\n   - Lines: Yellow.\n   - Some areas previously covered by the dark purple background in the Input grid are preserved in the Output grid.\n\n2. **Structure**:\n   - The same horizontal and vertical yellow line structure is retained from the input grid.\n   - The background changes from dark purple to medium blue.\n   - Certain squares within the structure of yellow lines retain the original dark purple background.\n\n### Transformation Rules:\n1. **Background Color Change**:\n   - The overall background color is changed from dark purple to medium blue.\n\n2. **Preserved Areas**:\n   - Areas that are completely enclosed by the yellow lines (forming distinct squares or rectangles), or at the intersections of yellow lines, retain the original dark purple background color.\n   - These preserved areas correspond exactly to the enclosed regions formed by the intersections of the yellow lines, creating small dark purple squares within the larger blue background of the grid.\n\n### Detailed Transformation Steps:\n1. **Identify the background**:\n   -", "f8a8fe49": "In the provided input and output grids, the transformation involves the repositioning of certain elements while retaining their initial configurations and colors. Here is a detailed description of the transformation:\n\n1. **Grid Composition and Colors:**\n   - **Background Color:** Both input and output grids have a consistent dark purple background.\n   - **Primary Shapes and Colors:** The grids contain yellow and teal blocks. \n\n2. **Input Grid:**\n   - The input grid consists of a central structure with two symmetrical teal \"C\"-shaped formations facing each other. \n   - Between these teal formations, there are yellow blocks arranged into two vertical segments. \n     - The left vertical segment has three yellow blocks stacked vertically.\n     - The right vertical segment has a single yellow block aligned horizontally with the middle yellow block of the left stack.\n\n3. **Output Grid:**\n   - The output grid keeps the teal \"C\"-shaped formations in the same positions.\n   - The yellow blocks are repositioned:\n     - The left vertical segment has become a vertical stack of three yellow blocks, shifted one block to the right.\n     - The yellow block that was horizontally aligned in the input is now part of the vertical stack, making the stack four blocks in length.\n     - The now singular yellow block from the right vertical segment is moved outside the teal formations to the rightmost column, but at the same vertical level it occupied originally (aligned with the middle block of the former left stack).\n\n4. **Key Transformation", "9dfd6313": "The transformation between the input and output grids involves a specific replacement of colored squares within the grid. \n\n**Input Grid Description:**\n- The grid is a 3x3 matrix with the following colors in the cells:\n  - Top-left: Yellow\n  - Top-center: Yellow\n  - Top-right: Purple\n  - Middle-left: Teal\n  - Middle-center: Yellow\n  - Middle-right: Purple\n  - Bottom-left: Purple\n  - Bottom-center: Purple\n  - Bottom-right: Yellow\n\n**Output Grid Description:**\n- The grid is a 3x3 matrix with the following changes from the input grid:\n  - Top-left: Yellow (unchanged)\n  - Top-center: Teal (changed from Yellow)\n  - Top-right: Purple (unchanged)\n  - Middle-left: Purple (changed from Teal)\n  - Middle-center: Yellow (unchanged)\n  - Middle-right: Yellow (changed from Purple)\n  - Bottom-left: Purple (unchanged)\n  - Bottom-center: Purple (unchanged)\n  - Bottom-right: Yellow (unchanged)\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\n\n1. **Top-row Transformation:**\n   - The top-center square, which was Yellow in the input, is changed to Teal in the output.\n\n2. **Middle-row Transformation:**\n   - The middle-left square, which was Teal in the input, is changed to Purple in the output.\n   - The middle-right", "3af2c5a8": "In the puzzle images provided for `Train Input 2` and `Train Output 2`, a distinct transformation occurs.
